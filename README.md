# svite

a fresh start for svite based on vite2 repo structure and setup

nothing is finished, right now this is a testbed to make vite-plugin-svelte work based on @rixo s fork of rollup-plugin-svelte



## dev
* run `yarn`to install
* run  `yarn dev` in `packages/vite-plugin-svelte` to autobuild plugin
* run `yarn dev` in `packages/playground/default-svelte-template` to start vite

changes in plugin need restart of dev server
